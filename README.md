# Car Price Prediction
I utilized the train_test_split function from the Scikit-learn (sklearn) library to split the dataset into training and testing subsets, enabling effective model evaluation and validation.
I used the decision tree regression algorithm to train a car price prediction model , achieving accuraccy about 91.75%.
